# goudpserver

This started as an experiment in creating a UDP server.

It now does TCP too and handles incoming messages that exercise a set of leaky buckets.

I've used it as a playground to try out:

- UDP servers
- TCP servers
- terminating gracefully
- thread safety
- automated testing
- prometheus metrics
